* This are my dotfiles
Dotfiles are kept in a separate repository in =~/src/dot/=.
You need [[https://ansible.org/][Ansible]] and [[s][Git]] to install this configuration.
Instalation is done by softlinking files in this repo to your *$HOME*. It is done in [tasks/link-configuration.yaml] file.
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install ansible, git
cd ~/src/dot/
ansible-playbook tasks/link-configuration.yaml
#+end_src

To perform full installation use [[tasks/main.yaml]].
