* This are my dotfiles
Dotfiles are kept in a separate repository in =~/src/dot/=.
You need [[https://ansible.org/][Ansible]] and [[https://git-scm.com/][Git]] to install this configuration.
Instalation is done by softlinking files in this repo to your *$HOME*. It is done in [[tasks/link-configuration.yml]] file.
#+begin_src sh
sudo apt install ansible git
cd ~/src/dot/
ansible-playbook tasks/main.yml
#+end_src

To perform full installation use [[tasks/main.yml]].
